# A React Relay Modern todolist app

I also used found-relay to handle the routing. 

The server uses GraphQL with Javascript objects as the data access object so there's no real persistence.

I included a login page (try francoisa/password) 

The authentication uses cookies and the creates a sessionMiddleware class to handle the jwt token.

I used minimal styling so I could understand the basic logic.
